--- Working Principle

The Room Cleaner Robot uses sensor feedback and algorithmic control to autonomously clean the environment.

1. The microcontroller initializes the movement system and sensors.


2. Ultrasonic sensors detect any approaching obstacles.


3. Upon detection, the control logic determines a new path for navigation.


4. Simultaneously, the cleaning mechanism operates continuously to collect dust and debris.


5. The robot repeats this cycle, ensuring complete floor coverage until stopped or the battery depletes.
